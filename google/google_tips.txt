-> Use quotes
When searching for something specific, try using quotes to minimize the guesswork for Google search. When you put your search parameters in quotes, it tells the search engine to search for the whole phrase: “Puppy Dog Sweaters”

-> Use a hyphen to exclude words
Sometimes you may find yourself searching for a word with an ambiguous meaning. An example is Mustang. When you Google search for Mustang, you may get results for both the car made by Ford or the horse. If you want to cut one out, use the hyphen to tell the engine to ignore content with one of the other. See the example: Mustang -cars

-> Use the asterisk wildcard
The asterisk wildcard is one of the most useful ones on the list. Here’s how it works.
When you use an asterisk in a search term on Google search, it will leave a placeholder that may be automatically filled by the search engine later. This is a brilliant way to find song lyrics if you don’t know all the words. Let’s look at the syntax:
* “Come * right now * me”

-> Use a colon to search specific sites
There may be an instance where you need to Google search for articles or content on a certain website. The syntax is very simple and we’ll show you:Sidney Crosby site:nhl.com
This will search for all content about famous hockey player Sidney Crosby, but only on NHL.com. 

-> Find sites that are similar to other sites
Let’s say you have a favorite website. It can be anything. However, that website is getting a little bit boring and you want to find other websites like it. You would use this trick. Below is the syntax:
* related:amazon.com

-> Search for multiple words at once
Google search is flexible. It knows you may not find what you want by searching only a single word or phrase. Thus, it lets you search for multiples.
By using this trick, you can search for one word or phrase along with a second word or phrase. This can help narrow down your search to help you find exactly what you’re looking for. Here is the syntax:
* “Best ways to prepare for a job interview” OR “How to prepare for a job interview”

-> Search a range of numbers
Essentially, you use two dots and a number to let Google search know you’re looking for a specific range of numbers. Like the syntax below:
* What teams have won the Stanley Cup ..2004
* 41..43
In the first instance, the search will toss back the team that won the Stanley Cup in 2004. The two dots with only one number will tell the search that you don’t need anything before or after 2004. This can help narrow down searches to a specific number to improve search results.
In the second, Google will search for the numbers 41, 42, and 43. It is obscure, but wildly useful if you happen to need to search for numbers like this.

-> Find a specific file
An often forgotten feature of Google search is the ability to search for a specific file or file type. This can be infinitely useful if you need a specific PDF or PowerPoint file that you previously viewed or need to use for another project. The syntax is quite simple:
* *Search term here* filetype:pdf

-> Use Google search to do math
Google search can actually do math for you. You can ask it basic questions or some more difficult ones.

-> Money and unit conversions
Google search can quickly and accurately convert both measurement units and currency value.

-> Track your packages
Our last trick is to use Google search to find out where your packages are. You can enter any UPS, USPS, or Fedex tracking number directly into the Google search bar, and it’ll show you the tracking information about your package.

-> Keep it simple
Now we’re getting into the general tips. Google search knows how to search for a lot of things. What this means is you don’t need to be too specific. If you need a pizza place nearby, use this to search.
* Pizza places nearby

-> Gradually add search terms
There will come a time when Google search doesn’t shovel out the results you expect. In this instance, keeping it simple may not be the best option.
As Google itself suggests, the best method is to start with something simple then gradually get more complicated. See the example below:
* First try: job interviews
* Second try: prepare for job interviews
* Third try: how to prepare for a job interview
This will gradually refine the search to bring you fewer, more targeted terms. The reason you don’t go straight from the first try to the third try is because you may miss what you’re looking for by skipping the second step.
Millions of websites phrase the same information in a number of different ways; using this technique lets you search as many of them as possible to find the best info.

-> Use words that websites would use
This is a very important one. When people use Google search to hunt the web, they generally search for things using the same language that they would use for speaking.
Unfortunately, websites don’t say things the way people do; instead, they try to use language that sounds professional. Let’s look at some examples:
* “I have a flat tire” could be replaced by “repair a flat tire.”
* “My head hurts” could be replaced by “headache relief.”

-> Use important words only
The way Google search works is to take what you search for and match it with keywords in online content.
When you search for too many words, it may limit your results. That means it may actually take you longer to find what you’re looking for. Thus, it is apropos to use only the important words when searching for something. Let’s see an example:
* Don’t use: Where can I find a Chinese restaurant that delivers.
* Instead try: Chinese restaurants nearby.
* Or: Chinese restaurants near me.

-> Google search has shortcuts
A number of commands can be entered to give you instantaneous results.
Like the math example above, Google can immediately give you the information you need that is displayed right at the top of the search results. This can save time and effort so you don’t have to click a bunch of bothersome links.
Here are a few examples of some commands you can enter into Google:
* Weather *zip code* – This will show you the weather in the given zip code. You can also use town and city names instead of area codes, but it may not be as accurate if there are multiple area codes in the city.
* What is *celebrity name* Bacon Number – This is a fun little one that will tell you how many connections any given celebrity has to famed actor Kevin Bacon. The popular joke, Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, is that no actor is more than 6 connections away from Kevin Bacon. Mark Zuckerberg has a Bacon Number of 3.
* The math example posted above is another one.
* What is the definition of *word* or Define: *word* – This will display the definition of a word.
* Time *place* – This will display the time in whatever place you type in.
* You can check any stock by typing its ticker name into Google. If you search for GOOG, it will check the stock prices for Google.

-> Spelling doesn’t necessarily matter
Google search has gotten a lot smarter over the years. These days, you don’t even need to spell words correctly.
As long as it’s pretty close, Google can usually figure out what it means.

-> Find a page that links to another page
This Google search tip is a little obscure. Instead of searching for a specific page, you’re searching for a page that links to a specific page.
Think about it this way. If you want to see who cited a New York Times article on their site, you would use this trick to find all the sites that link to it. The syntax is: 	link:nytimes.com
